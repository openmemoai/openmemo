# OpenMemo

OpenMemo gives AI systems long-term memory.

OpenMemo is an open-source memory layer designed for AI agents, assistants, and AI-driven workflows.
Instead of storing information as plain text, OpenMemo structures knowledge so AI systems can remember, resolve conflicts, and retrieve reliable facts over time.

## Why OpenMemo

Most AI systems forget.

Traditional prompts only hold temporary context. Once a session ends, information disappears or becomes inconsistent.

OpenMemo solves this by providing a structured memory layer that allows AI systems to:

- Store knowledge persistently
- Resolve conflicting information
- Recall updated facts
- Build long-term contextual understanding

**Without OpenMemo:**
AI tools rely on short prompts and lose context quickly.

**With OpenMemo:**
AI systems maintain structured memory that evolves over time.

## Demo

Below is a simple example showing how OpenMemo handles conflicting information and reconstructs the latest truth.

```python
from openmemo import Memory

memory = Memory()

memory.add("User prefers dark mode")
memory.add("User changed preference to light mode")

results = memory.recall("What theme does the user prefer?")
print(results)
```

```
Output:
User preference: light mode
(conflict resolved from newer memory)
```

OpenMemo automatically detects conflicts and keeps the most reliable version of the knowledge.

## Key Features

- Structured memory storage for AI systems
- Conflict-aware knowledge updates
- Reliable memory recall
- Lightweight API for AI workflows
- Designed for AI agents and assistants

---

## Example Use Cases

OpenMemo can power memory for many AI applications:

- AI assistants that remember user preferences
- Customer support agents with persistent context
- Research tools that track evolving knowledge
- AI workflows that require reliable memory

---

## Built with OpenMemo

Example projects and cookbooks:

```
cookbooks/
  ai-assistant/
  customer-support/
  coding-agent/
```

These examples show how OpenMemo can be used as the memory layer for real AI systems.
