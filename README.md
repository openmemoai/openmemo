# OpenMemo

> OpenMemo is an AI-native structured memory system for long-term knowledge.

Instead of storing notes as plain text, OpenMemo organizes information into structured data that AI systems can understand, retrieve, and reuse.

---

## Why OpenMemo

Most notes are written for humans.

But modern AI systems work best when knowledge is structured, contextual, and connected.

OpenMemo helps transform everyday information into a structured memory layer that powers:

- AI-assisted workflows
- Knowledge retrieval
- Research systems
- Long-term memory
- Automation pipelines

---

## Architecture

OpenMemo converts raw information into structured memory.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Notes] --> E[Parsing Engine]
    B[Documents] --> E
    C[Web Clips] --> E
    D[Conversations] --> E

    E --> F[Entity Extraction]
    F --> G[Structured Memory Model]

    G --> H[Memory Store]
    G --> I[Search Index]
    G --> J[Knowledge Graph]

    H --> K[AI Retrieval]
    I --> K
    J --> L[AI Assistants]
    J --> M[Research Workflows]
```

OpenMemo transforms raw notes into structured memory AI can actually use.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allanyao/openmemo.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Quick example:

```python
from openmemo import Memory

memory = Memory()

memory.add("User prefers dark mode")
memory.add("Project deadline is March 15")

results = memory.recall("user preference")
for r in results:
    print(r["content"], r["score"])
```
